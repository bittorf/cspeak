CSpeak[1] is a very simple speech synthesis library written in C. It consists
of only ~140 lines of code, half of which is a formant lookup table.

For a demo, run the daisy.sh script.

To perform text-to-speech (TTS) on an English phrase, run the reciter.sh
script, e.g.:
    ./reciter.sh The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    ./reciter.sh "Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do,
                  I'm half crazy all for the love of you.
                  It won't be a stylish marriage,
                  I can't afford a carriage,
                  But you'll look sweet upon the seat
                  Of a bicycle made for two."
    ./reciter.sh `cat alice.txt`

The table of formants and the Daisy Bell demo are adapted from Cantarino[2].
