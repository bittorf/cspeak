CSpeak[1] is a very simple speech synthesis library written in C. It consists
of only ~140 lines of code, half of which is a formant lookup table.

For a demo, run the daisy.sh script. To perform text-to-speech (TTS) on an
English phrase, run the reciter.sh script, e.g.:
    ./reciter.sh The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

The table of formants and the Daisy Bell demo are adapted from Cantarino[2].
See [3] for a list of supported phonemes.
